Public: A class, method declared public can be accessed from any other class
Private: Methods, variables that are declared private can only be accessed within the class. Class and interfaces cannot be private.
Variables that are declared private can be accessed outside the class, if public getter methods are present in the class (Private use-object encapsulates itself and hides data from the outside world)
Protected: Variables, methods which are declared protected in a superclass can be accessed only by the subclasses in other package 
Default: we do not explicitly declare an access modifier for a class, field, method, etc. A variable or method declared without any access modifier can access to any other class in the same package.
